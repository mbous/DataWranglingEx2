#Think about other ways you could have populated the missing values in the age column.
#Why would you pick any of those over the mean (or not)?
#A: simulate values from empirical distribution by using the calculated mean and std as argument

#You notice that many passengers donâ€™t have a cabin number associated with them.
#Does it make sense to fill missing cabin numbers with a value?
#A: I would not fill missing cabin numbers. It could be that a passenger did not reserve a cabin.
#What does a missing value here mean?
#A: A possible explanation is that the passenger did not reserve a cabin.
